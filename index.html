                Welcome to my coding exercise submission!
            </p>

            <p>
                Why did I do this in standard html/javascript instead of React?
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically just time.  It's been a couple of years since I worked in React consistently and I 
                didn't want to spend too much time googling how to do things in React when I can just 
                knock them out in standard javascript and dom manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll notice the intersection has 7 lanes on each side instead of 8.  After reading the description 
                I reached out to my product manager and suggested a normal intersection has the left turn lanes 
                lined up with each other so there wasn't a need to create a separate one for each group of 
                lanes.  After cussing me out for interrupting their weekend on a coding exercise they agreed so 
                I went in that direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't get to implementing the sensors or walk signal functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is an issue where the screen sticks sometimes.  My guess is it 
                has to do with too many active intervals running.  If I was going to fix that I would 
                look at using CSS transistions instead of moving the cars using intervals and re-positioning 
                the "cars".
            </p>

            <p>
                For this exercise the number of cars we generate is capped at 102.  If you want to 
                have this run indefinitely for some reason just take out the counter check in the 
                start method in the intersection.js file.
            </p>
